# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

The goal for this project is to find which Apps are returning the most value for ad revenue spent. Higher value ads are the ones seen by more people. Therefore this project aims to find which tpes of ads attract the most users.

The two main stores where people purchase free and non-free apps are Google and Andriod. There are over 4 million apps in both the App store and Google Play. To ease working with this dataset, a smaple will be used containing 10,000 Andriod apps from Google Play, and 7,000 apps from the App Store.

**EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS**
- Find most common genre

**IOS RESULTS**
For IOS App store, the resutls show an overwhelming (58%) amount of Apps that fall into the Game genre. Runner up being entertainment at 7.8% and photo and video at 4.9%. This table shows that the IOS App store is more popular with entertainment apps, rather than ultility apps. 

Although this table shows that Games and Entertainment are overwhelming popular on the IOS platform, this could be due to developers creating many different types of these apps becasuse there could be more room for creativity or some other factor. This does not confirm that these apps also have the most users, and it alone can not confirm that the company should make a App that falls into the game Genre. It could in fact show that the Game genre is oversaturated in this market with heavy compition. 

**ANDROID RESULTS**
The 'Prime Genre' column has too many different categories which the apps can fall into. The number is not comparable to the IOS app store, and the large amount can give unclear results. For this reason it is better to analyze the result from the 'Category' column in the Android dataset.

Family (18.9%) is the most popular followed by 'Game' (9.7%). 'Tools' (8.4%), 'Business', 'Lifestyle', 'Productivity', and 'Finance'. These results show that the Android Apps focus on Family and games first, and then have more practical uses. The Family Category is not completly self-explanatory, and it might be of use to examine what apps are falling under this category.
